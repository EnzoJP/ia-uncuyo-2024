2.10 Consider a modified version of the vacuum environment in Exercise 2.8, in which the
agent is penalized one point for each movement.

a. Can a simple reflex agent be perfectly rational for this environment? Explain.
b. What about a reflex agent with state? Design such an agent.
c. How do your answers to a and b change if the agent’s percepts give it the clean/dirty
status of every square in the environment?


2.11 Consider a modified version of the vacuum environment in Exercise 2.8, in which the
geography of the environment—its extent, boundaries, and obstacles—is unknown, as is the
initial dirt configuration. (The agent can go Up and Down as well as Left and Right.)


a. Can a simple reflex agent be perfectly rational for this environment? Explain.
b. Can a simple reflex agent with a randomized agent function outperform a simple reflex
agent? Design such an agent and measure its performance on several environments.
c. Can you design an environment in which your randomized agent will perform poorly?
Show your results.
d. Can a reflex agent with state outperform a simple reflex agent? Design such an agent
and measure its performance on several environments. Can you design a rational agent
of this type?
